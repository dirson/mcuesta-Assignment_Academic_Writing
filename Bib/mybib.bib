abstract = "Hybrid renewable energy system has been introduced as a green and reliable power system for remote areas. There is a steady increase in usage of hybrid renewable energy units and consequently optimization problem solving for this system is a necessity. In recent years, researchers are interested in using multi-objective optimization methods for this issue. Therefore, in the present study, an overview of applied multi-objective methods by using evolutionary algorithms for hybrid renewable energy systems was proposed to help the present and future research works. The result shows that there are a few studies about optimization of many objects in a hybrid system by these algorithms and the most popular applied methods are genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization."

abstract="The characteristics of power produced from photovoltaic (PV) and Wind systems are based on the weather condition. Both the system are very unreliable in itself without sufficient capacity storage devices like batteries or back-up system like conventional engine generators. The reliability of the system significantly increases when two systems are hybridized with the provision of storage device. Even in such case, sufficient battery bank capacity is required to provide power to the load in extended cloudy days and non-windy days. Therefore the optimal sizing of system component represents the important part of hybrid power system. This paper summarizes recent trends of energy usage from renewable sources. It discusses physical modeling of renewable energy systems, several methodologies and criteria for optimization of the Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES). HRES is getting popular in the present scenario of energy and environmental crises. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the current state of optimization techniques specifically suited for the small and isolated power system based on the published literatures. The recent trend in optimization in the field of hybrid renewable energy system shows that artificial intelligence may provide good optimization of system without extensive long term weather data.",

abstract = "Fast depleting fossil fuels and the growing awareness for environmental protection have led us to the energy crisis. Hence, efforts are being made by researchers to investigate new ways to extract energy from renewable sources. ‘Microgrids’ with Distributed Generators (DG) are being implemented with renewable energy systems. Optimization methods justify the cost of investment of a microgrid by enabling economic and reliable utilization of the resources. This paper strives to bring to light the concept of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) and state of art application of optimization tools and techniques to microgrids, integrating renewable energies. With an extensive literature survey on HRES, a framework of diverse objectives has been outlined for which optimization approaches were applied to empower the microgrid. A review of modelling and applications of renewable energy generation and storage sources is also presented."
